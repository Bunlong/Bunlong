Hello there,

I craft, code and build open source software that is used by thousands of developers, startups companies, and hopefully you and/or your company too.

Most of my open source software is written in Javascript, and is solving difficult problems for thousands of devs all over the world each day.

Open source libraries:

* [reactpatterns](https://github.com/reactpatterns/reactpatterns) â€“ React patterns & techniques to use in development for React Developer.
* [react-papaparse](https://github.com/Bunlong/react-papaparse) â€“ The fastest in-browser CSV (or delimited text) parser for React.
* [react-webspeech](https://github.com/Bunlong/react-webspeech) â€“ The official WebSpeech for React.

If you have any further questions, feel free to send me a tweet or DM [@bunlongvan](https://twitter.com/bunlongvan) on Twitter. Thanks!

<strong>I'm here to support you.</strong>
