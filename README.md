<!--

Hello there!

I craft, code and build open source software that is used by thousands of developers, startups companies, and hopefully you and/or your company too.

Most of my open source software is written in Javascript and focused on React, Data Visualization, and Enterprise Application Architecture.

* C / C++ / Algorithms are my strong background programming languages

I craft, code and build open source software and most of my open source software is written in JavaScript and focused on React, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Enterprise Application Architecture.
